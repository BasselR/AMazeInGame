3A04 -- final project for software architectural design

## Todo
\[ ] Minigame 1 (Niyatha) - Player has to collect objects scattered around minigame map before time runs out  

\[ ] Minigame 2 (Albert) - User explores one of a set of predetermined mazes. Each maze has a unique layout with a variety of items of different scores that can be picked up. There is also a bot for each maze that moves along a predetermined path. The player and bot compete against each other in collecting items. When all items have been collected, the user wins if they have a higher score. If the user loses, they lose health proportional to the difference in score..(Bot can be further developed to be able to make pathing decisions instead of predetermined paths).  

\[ ] Minigame 3 (Bassel) -  User has to last for x seconds in the minigame without being hit by projectiles which come flying in from different edges of the screen (can have 1 life, can have multiple, etc) -- similar to some undertale boss fights  

\[ ] Minigame 4 (Sharjil) - The user has to go through a parkour obstacle course game. They’ll be given a predetermined map randomly with a different outline for each and a different time limit. User will have to complete the course within that time frame or without falling in a pit. If the user falls or runs out of time, they’ll have to start all over again, no checkpoints.  

\[ ] Minigame 5 (Youssef) - The user has to shoot x number of enemies/aliens in the minigame. As the user shoots down the aliens, their number will decrease. They will be removed from the game. In response, the aliens will fire back at the user. The user will have x number of lives and has to defeat all aliens before they shoot him x times to win.
